\chapter{Harmonic Oscilator}

We want to use the algebra we learnt in the previous chaoter, for that we will try to solve the problem where the potential V(x), is a one dimensional harmonic oscilator potential.

\section{Definition}

The potential for an harmonic oscilator in 1 dimension is given by the expresion:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{cc}
    V(x) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 & k > 0
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
