\chapter{Multiple potentials}

Until this moment we have only work with 1 potential well but if our goal is to understand solids and their properties we need to figure out how our quantum world works with multiple potential.


\section{Definition}

\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{images5/def.png}
  \centering
  \caption{Multiple delta function potentials problem.}
  \labfig{fig_5.1}
\end{marginfigure}

In this problem we will have N delta function potentials, as the one in the previous chapter, separated by a distance d, with a fix value for g of g=1. The potential can be defined as:

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.1}
  "V(x) = -2 V_0 a \left[\sum_{n=1}^{N} \delta(x-nd) \right]"
\end{equation}

Using \ref{5.1} we get the wave equation for this problem.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.2}
  "\alpha^2\phi(x) = \frac{\partial^2\phi(x)}{\partial x^2} + 2 g \left[\sum_{n=1}^{N} \delta(x-nd) \right] \phi(x)"
\end{equation}

Outside of the potentials the equation to solve will be the same as \ref{4.6}, our goal is going to be trying to find the relation between the A and B coefficients at both sides of a potential as we can see in \reffig{fig_5.2}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics{images5/def_n.png}
  \centering
  \caption{Coefficients outside of the potentials near x=nd.}
  \labfig{fig_5.2}
\end{figure}

\section{Solution}

Our potential at $x=nd$ will look like \reffig{fig_5.2} and the solution at the left and right side of the potential in x=nd will be: \marginnote[2pt]{We are adding the term $ -nd\pm d/2$ in the exponential because it will make the math easier later.}


\begin{equation}
  \label{5.3}
  \begin{array}{lc}
    \phi(x) = A_{n-1}e^{-\alpha(x-[nd-\frac{d}{2}])}+B_{n-1}e^{\alpha(x-[nd-\frac{d}{2}])} & x < nd
    \\

    \\
    \phi(x) = A_{n}e^{-\alpha(x-[nd+\frac{d}{2}])}+B_{n}e^{\alpha(x-[nd+\frac{d}{2}])} & x > nd
  \end{array}
\end{equation}



First, if we look at the limits when n=1 and n=N we get the solutions from the previous chapter.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.4}
  \begin{array}{l}
    A_0 = 0 \\
    B_N = 0
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

We will use the continuity of the function and its derivatives, as we already explain in Chapter 4, to relate the A and B coefficients.

The first condition is that $\phi(x)$ is continuous. To simplify we will use $v = e^{-\alpha\frac{d}{2}}$.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.5}
  A_{n-1}v+\frac{B_{n-1}}{v} = \frac{A_n}{v}+B_n v
\end{equation}

The second condition is our relation between the derivatives in $x=nd$ shown in \ref{4.11}

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.6}
  \begin{array}{l}
    [-\alpha A_{n-1} v + \alpha \frac{B_{n-1}}{v}]-[-\alpha\frac{A_n}{v}+\alpha B_n v] = 2[A_{n-1}v+\frac{B_{n-1}}{v}]
    \\

    \\
    A_{n-1}(-\alpha v-2v)+B_{n-1}(\frac{\alpha}{v}-\frac{2}{v}) = -\alpha A_n \frac{1}{v}+\alpha B_n v
    \\

    \\
    -A_n\frac{1}{v} + B_n v = -vA_{n-1}(1+\frac{2}{\alpha})+\frac{1}{v}B_{n-1}(1-\frac{2}{\alpha})
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

If we add and substract both conditions we will get the next equations:

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.7}
  \begin{array}{l}
    B_n = -\frac{1}{\alpha} A_{n-1} + \frac{1}{v^2}(1-\frac{1}{\alpha}) B_{n-1}
    \\

    \\
    A_n = v^2(1+\frac{1}{\alpha})A_{n-1} + \frac{1}{\alpha} B_{n-1}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

We want to show this like a matrix.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.8}
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
    A_n
    \\

    \\
    B_n
  \end{array}
  \right) =
  \left[
    \begin{array}{cc}
      v^2(1+\frac{1}{\alpha}) & \frac{1}{\alpha}
      \\

      \\
      -\frac{1}{v} & \frac{1}{v^2}(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})
    \end{array}
  \right]
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
    A_{n-1}
    \\

    \\
    B_{n-1}
  \end{array}
  \right)
\end{equation}

We will called this matrix T. Now we can relate any index with each other because T does not depend on n, i.e. $T = T(\alpha,d)$. Now we will find the solutions for alpha using the relation between n=1 and n=N coefficients.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.9}
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
    A_N
    \\

    \\
    B_N
  \end{array}
  \right) =
  \left[
    T
  \right]^N
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
    A_{0}
    \\

    \\
    B_{0}
  \end{array}
  \right)
\end{equation}

To solve for alpha we will use \ref{5.4}.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.10}
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
    A_N
    \\

    \\
    0
  \end{array}
  \right) =
  \left[
    \begin{array}{cc}
      (T^N)_{11} & (T^N)_{12}
      \\

      \\
      (T^N)_{21} & (T^N)_{22}
    \end{array}
  \right]
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
    0
    \\

    \\
    B_{0}
  \end{array}
  \right)
\end{equation}

For this equations to be true we get the condition, $(T^N)_{22}=0$. This will give the solutions for alpha and will depend only on d. \marginnote[2pt]{However, the number of solutions for alpha will be dependent on N, i.e. the number of delta function potentials}


\section{Solutions for N = 1,2}

Now that we have the general solution, we can try to get the simplest examples.

For N = 1 it will be extremely simple.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.11}
  \frac{1}{v^2}(1-\frac{1}{\alpha}) = 0
\end{equation}

Solving for $\alpha$ we get $\alpha=1$ that exactly the value for g, this tell us that when N=1 we recover the solution from the previous chapter, wich make sense.

For N = 2 we need to square the matrix.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.12}
  \begin{array}{c}
    T^2 = \left[
      \begin{array}{cc}
        v^2(1+\frac{1}{\alpha}) & \frac{1}{\alpha}
        \\

        \\
        -\frac{1}{\alpha} & \frac{1}{v^2}(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})
      \end{array}
    \right]^2=

    \\

    \\

    =\left[
      \begin{array}{cc}
        v^2(1+\frac{1}{\alpha}) & \frac{1}{\alpha}
        \\

        \\
        -\frac{1}{\alpha} & \frac{1}{v^2}(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})
      \end{array}
    \right]
    \left[
      \begin{array}{cc}
        v^2(1+\frac{1}{\alpha}) & \frac{1}{\alpha}
        \\

        \\
        -\frac{1}{\alpha} & \frac{1}{v^2}(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})
      \end{array}
    \right] =

    \\

    \\

    =
    \left[
      \begin{array}{cc}
        v^4(1+\frac{1}{\alpha})^2-\frac{1}{\alpha^2} & \frac{1}{\alpha}[v^2(1+\frac{1}{\alpha})+\frac{1}{v}(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})]
        \\

        \\
        -\frac{1}{\alpha}[v^2(1+\frac{1}{\alpha})+\frac{1}{v}(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})] & -\frac{1}{\alpha^2} + \frac{1}{v^4}(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})^2
      \end{array}
    \right]
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

From the expresion of $T_{22}$ we can get the solutions for alpha.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.13}
  \begin{array}{c}
    -\frac{1}{\alpha^2} + \frac{1}{v^4}(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})^2 = 0 \\
    \pm \frac{1}{\alpha} = e^{\alpha d}(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

We get two different solutions from this equation.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.14}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \alpha = 1 + e^{-\alpha d}

    \\

    \alpha = 1 - e^{-\alpha d}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{images5/N=2,d=2.png}
  \centering
  \caption{Solutions for $(T^N)_{22} = 0$ for N=2 and d=2}
  \labfig{fig_5.3}
\end{marginfigure}

If we plot both sides of the equations we can see two different results depending on d. If d is greater than 1 we will get two solutions if d is least than 1 we will only find one solution. This can be observe in \reffig{fig_5.3} and \reffig{fig_5.4}. \marginnote{The solutions have been found using numerical analysis.}

\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{images5/N=2,d=0.5.png}
  \centering
  \caption{Solutions for $(T^N)_{22} = 0$ for N=2 and d=0.5}
  \labfig{fig_5.4}
\end{marginfigure}

As N increase with a fix d the number of alphas will increase until the discrete turns into a almost continuous behaviour. With N from 1 to 40 we can see the behaviour for alpha when d=2.

  \includegraphics[H]{images5/N_alpha_d=2.png}

  \caption{alpha as a function of N for $d = 2$.}
  \labfig{fig_5.5}
\end{figure}

\section{Solving for x as a circunference}

If we assume x axis is not a straight line, and instead it is inside a circunference of length L, like \reffig{fig_5.6}, the math will look better and we will get some interesting new results.

\begin{marginfigure}
  \begin{tikzpicture}

    \draw[black] (0,0) circle (2);
    \draw[->] (0,2) -- (0,1);
    \draw[->] (1.4,1.4) -- (0.7,0.7);
    \draw[->] (-1.4,-1.4) -- (-0.7,-0.7);
    \filldraw[black] (-1.6,-1.4) circle (0) node [anchor=north]{kd};
    \filldraw[black] (3,2) circle (0) node [anchor=east]{L=Nd};
    \draw[->] (0,2.2) arc (90:45:2.2) node[anchor=south]{d};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption[x as a circunference]{x as a circunference of distance L.}
    \labfig{fig_5.6}
\end{marginfigure}

Because we have N potentials separated a distance d, we can say that $L= Nd$. When N is infinite we will have again that L is aproximately infinite and therefore the circunference will recover the straight line shape.

One of the consequences of this new aproach is that now E is not confined to only negative values. We know get a new wave equation where E is the energy.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.15}
  -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2} + V(x)\phi(x) = E\phi(x)
\end{equation}

We have to solve this equation with our boundaries as before, but we have new boundaries as a result of our transformation. We can use the rotation simetry to say that now our function is periodic. This give us new conditions:


\begin{equation}
  \label{5.16}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \phi(x+L) = \phi(x)

    \\

    \frac{d\phi}{dx}(x+L) = \frac{d\phi}{dx}(x)

    \\

    V(x+L) = V(x)
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

We want to go even further and solve problems where $V(x)$ is periodic in d instead of L, i.e. $V(x+d)=V(x)$.

In this case we say, and it can be prove, that $\phi(x)$ is quasi-periodic.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.17}
  \phi(x+d) = C \phi(x)
\end{equation}

After the N potentials $\phi(x)$ must be the same again according to \ref{5.16}.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.18}
  \phi(x+Nd) = C^N \phi(x) = \phi(x+L) = \phi(x)
\end{equation}

This means that $C^N = 1$ and this lead us to N solutions for C.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.19}
  \begin{array}{lc}
    C = e^{i\frac{2\pi}{N}k} & k=0,1,2,...,N-1
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

We will solve the problem between d/2 and -d/2 as we can see in \reffig{fig_5.7}

\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{images5/quasiperf.png}
  \centering
  \caption{Potential between -d/2 and d/2}
  \labfig{fig_5.7}
\end{marginfigure}

Outside of the potential the wave equation is:

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.20}
  \frac{d^2\phi(x)}{dx^2} =
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{lc}
    \alpha^2 \phi(x) & E < 0
    \\
    \beta^2  \phi(x) & E > 0
  \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation}

The solution fo this equations is the same as the one in Chapter 4, but we will change the notation, intead of terms of n we will called the coefficients $A_L$, $B_L$ and $A_R$, $B_R$, for left and right of the potential.

Let's resume all the conditions.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.21}
  \begin{array}{lc}
    I) & \phi(d/2) = C \phi(-d/2)

    \\

    \\

    II) & \frac{\phi}{dx}(d/2) = C \frac{\phi}{dx}(-d/2)

    \\

    \\

    III) & \phi(x=0^{-}) = \phi(x=0^{+})

    \\

    \\

    IV) & \left.\frac{d\phi}{dx}\right|_{x=0^{-}} - \left.\frac{d\phi}{dx}\right|_{x=0^{+}} = 2\phi(0)
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

We have to solve for this conditions. We will use $v = e^{d\alpha/2}$ to simplify the math.


\begin{equation}
  \label{5.22}
  \begin{array}{lc}

    I + II & B_R = \frac{C}{v^2} B_L

    \\

    \\

    I-II & A_R = C v^2 A_L

    \\

    \\

    III => & (Cv^2-1) A_L = (1-\frac{C}{v^2}) B_L

    \\

    \\

    IV => & [-A_L\alpha+B_L\alpha] - [-A_R\alpha + B_R\alpha] = 2[A_L + B_L]
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

Combining the four expresions we can get the equation to solve alpha for.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.23}
  \cos{\left(\frac{2\pi k}{N}\right)} = \cosh{(\alpha d)} - \frac{1}{\alpha} \sinh{(\alpha d)}
\end{equation}

If d and N are given we can get $\alpha(k)$.

We have to do a numerical analisis of the function in the right side. First, we want to find the limit for $\alpha \to 0$. We will need to use Taylor expansion to solve it.

\begin{equation}
  \label{5.24}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \lim_{\alpha \to 0} (\cosh{(\alpha d)} - \frac{1}{\alpha} \sinh{(\alpha d)}) =
    \\

    \\
    = \cosh{(0)} - \lim_{\alpha \to 0} \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{e^{\alpha d}-e^{-\alpha d}}{2} =
    \\

    \\
    = 1 - \lim_{\alpha \to 0} \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{2\alpha d + o(\alpha^2)}{2} = 1-d
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

Now we want to see how the monotony of the function behaves, so we have to look at the derivative of the function. We will use taylor expansion again.


\begin{equation}
  \label{5.25}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \frac{d}{dx}\left[\cosh{(\alpha d)} - \frac{1}{\alpha} \sinh{(\alpha d)} \right] =
    \\

    \\
    = \left(\alpha + \frac{1}{\alpha^2}\right)\sinh{(\alpha d)} -\frac{d}{\alpha}\cosh{(\alpha d)} \approx
    \\

    \\
    \approx \alpha d^2 (1-\frac{d}{3}) + o(\alpha^3)
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

If d is greater than 3 the function decreases first and then it increases until infinity. If d is less than 3 the function increases for all $\alpha$. Is not important for us where the minimum is located, the key aspect is that if d is greater than 3 we get solutions for bigger alphas of the equation because the left function is confine in [-1,1].

In \reffig{fig_5.8} we can see that for fixed values of N we can get all the energies.

% \chapter{Page Design}
% \labch{layout}

% \section{Headings}

% So far, in this document I used two different styles for the chapter
% headings: one has the chapter name, a rule and, in the margin, the
% chapter number; the other has an image at the top of the page, and the
% chapter title is printed in a box (like for this chapter). There is one
% additional style, which I used only in the \nrefch{appendix}; there, the chapter title is enclosed in two
% horizontal rules, and the chapter number (or letter, in the case of the
% appendix) is above it.\sidenote{To be honest, I do not think that mixing
% heading styles like this is a wise choice, but in this document I did it
% only to show you how they look.}

% Every book is unique, so it makes sense to have different styles from
% which to choose. Actually, it would be awesome if whenever a
% \Class{kao}-user designs a new heading style, he or she added it to the
% three styles already present, so that it will be available for new users
% and new books.

% The choice of the style is made simple by the \Command{setchapterstyle}
% command. It accepts one option, the name of the style, which can be:
% \enquote{plain}, \enquote{kao}, \enquote{bar}, or
% \enquote{lines}.\sidenote{Plain is the default \LaTeX\xspace title
% style; the other ones are self explanatory.} If instead you want the
% image style, you have to use the command \Command{setchapterimage},
% which accepts the path to the image as argument; you can also provide an
% optional parameter in square brackets to specify the height of the
% image. \Command{setchapterimage} automatically sets the chapter style to
% \enquote{bar} for that chapter (and also for subsequent chapters).

% Let us make some examples. In this book, I begin a normal chapter with
% the lines:
% \begin{lstlisting}
% \setchapterstyle{kao}
% \setchapterpreamble[u]{\margintoc}
% \chapter{Title of the Chapter}
% \labch{title}
% \end{lstlisting}

% In Line 1 I choose the style for the title to be \enquote{kao}. Then, I
% specify that I want the margin toc. The rest is ordinary administration
% in \LaTeX, except that I use my own \Command{labch} to label the
% chapter. Actually, the \Command{setchapterpreamble} is a standard
% \KOMAScript\xspace one, so I invite you to read about it in the KOMA
% documentation. Once the chapter style is set, it holds until you change
% it.\sidenote{The \Command{margintoc} has to be specified at every
% chapter. Perhaps in the future this may change; it all depends on how
% this feature will be welcomed by the users, so keep in touch with me if
% you have preferences!} Whenever I want to start a chapter with an image,
% I simply write:

% \begin{lstlisting}
% \setchapterimage[7cm]{path/to/image.png} % Optionally specify the height
% \setchapterpreamble[u]{\margintoc}
% \chapter{Catchy Title} % No need to set a chapter style
% \labch{catchy}
% \end{lstlisting}

% If you prefer, you can also specify the style at the beginning of the
% main document, and that style will hold until you change it again.

% \section{Headers \& Footers}

% Headers and footers in \KOMAScript\xspace are handled by the
% \Package{scrlayer-scrpage} package. There are two basic style:
% \enquote{scrheadings} and \enquote{plain.scrheadings}. The former is
% used for normal pages, whereas the latter is used in title pages (those
% where a new chapter starts, for instance) and, at least in this book, in
% the front matter. At any rate, the style can be changed with the
% \Command{pagestyle} command, \eg
% \lstinline|\pagestyle{plain.scrheadings}|.

% In both styles, the footer is completely empty. In plain.scrheadings,
% also the header is absent (otherwise it wouldn't be so plain\ldots), but
% in the normal style the design is reminiscent of the \enquote{kao} style
% for chapter titles.

% \begin{kaobox}[frametitle=To Do]
% The \Option{twoside} class option is still unstable and may lead to
% unexpected behaviours. As always, any help will be greatly appreciated.
% \end{kaobox}

% \section{Table of Contents}

% Another important part of a book is the table of contents. By default,
% in \Class{kaobook} there is an entry for everything: list of figures,
% list of tables, bibliographies, and even the table of contents itself.
% Not everybody might like this, so we will provide a description of the
% changes you need to do in order to enable or disable each of these
% entries. In the following \reftab{tocentries}, each item corresponds to
% a possible entry in the \acrshort{tocLabel}, and its description is the
% command you need to provide to have such entry. These commands are
% specified in the attached \href{style/style.sty}{style
% package},\sidenote{In the same file, you can also choose the titles of
% these entries.} so if you don't want the entries, just comment the
% corresponding lines.

% Of course, some packages, like those for glossaries and indices, will
% try to add their own entries.\marginnote{In a later section, we will see
% how you can define your own floating environment, and endow it with an
% entry in the \acrshort{tocLabel}.} In such cases, you have to follow the
% instructions specific to that package. Here, since we have talked about
% glossaries and notations in \refch{references}, we will briefly see how
% to configure them.

% \begin{table}
% \footnotesize
% \caption{Commands to add a particular entry to the table of contents.}
% \labtab{tocentries}
% \begin{tabular}{ l l }
% 	\toprule
% 	Entry & Command to Activate \\
% 	\midrule
% 	Table of Contents & \lstinline|\setuptoc{toc}{totoc}| \\
% 	List of Figs and Tabs & \lstinline|\PassOptionsToClass{toc=listof}{\@baseclass}| \\
% 	Bibliography & \lstinline|\PassOptionsToClass{toc=bibliography}{\@baseclass}| \\
% 	\bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% For the \Package{glossaries} package, use the \enquote{toc} option when
% you load it: \lstinline|\usepackage[toc]{glossaries}|. For
% \Package{nomencl}, pass the \enquote{intoc} option at the moment of
% loading the package. Both \Package{glossaries} and \Package{nomencl} are
% loaded in the attached \href{style/packages.sty}{\enquote{packages}
% package}.

% Additional configuration of the table of contents can be performed
% through the packages \Package{etoc}, which is loaded because it is
% needed for the margintocs, or the more traditional \Package{tocbase}.
% Read the respective documentations if you want to be able to change the
% default \acrshort{tocLabel} style.\sidenote[][*-1]{(And please, send me
% a copy of what you have done, I'm so curious!)}

% \section{Paper Size}

% Recent versions of Kaobook support paper sizes different from the
% default A4. It is possible to pass the name of the paper as an option
% to the class, as we are accustomed for any other \LaTeX\ class. For
% example, the class option \Option{b5paper} would set the paper size
% to the B5 format.

% We also support the paper sizes specified in
% \href{https://www.bod.de/hilfe/hilfe-und-service.html?cmd=SINGLE\&entryID=2494\_GER\_WSS\&eo=2\&title=welche-buchformate-gibt-es}{this
% web page} and some additional sizes requested by the users, with the
% option names specified in \reftab{papersizes}.

% For instance, to use the \enquote{smallpocketpaper} add the correct
% description at the beginning of the documentclass instruction:
% \begin{lstlisting}
% \documentclass[
% 		smallpocketpaper,
% 		fontsize=10pt,
% 		twoside=false,
% 		%open=any,
% 		secnumdepth=1,
% ]{kaobook}
% \end{lstlisting}

% \section{Page Layout}

% Besides the page style, you can also change the width of the content of
% a page. This is particularly useful for pages dedicated to part titles,
% where having the 1.5-column layout might be a little awkward, or for
% pages where you only put figures, where it is important to exploit all
% the available space.

% In practice, there are two layouts: \enquote{wide} and \enquote{margin}.
% The former suppresses the margins and allocates the full page for
% contents, while the latter is the layout used in most of the pages of
% this book, including this one. The wide layout is also used
% automatically in the front and back matters.

% \marginnote{Sometimes it is desirable to increase the width for just one
% or a few paragraphs; the \Environment{widepar} environment does that:
% wrap your paragraphs in this environment, and they will occupy the full
% width of the page.}

% To change page layout, use the \Command{pagelayout} command. For
% example, when I start a new part, I write:

% \begin{lstlisting}
% \pagelayout{wide}
% \addpart{Title of the New Part}
% \pagelayout{margin}
% \end{lstlisting}

% Beyond these two basic layouts, it is also possible to finely tune the
% page layout by redefining the \Command{marginlayout} command. This
% command is called internally by the higher-level \Command{pagelayout},
% and it is responsible for setting the width of the margins and of the
% text. The default definition is:

% \begin{lstlisting}
% \newcommand{\marginlayout}{%
% 	\newgeometry{
% 		top=27.4mm,				% height of the top margin
% 		bottom=27.4mm,			% height of the bottom margin
% 		inner=24.8mm,			% width of the inner margin
% 		textwidth=107mm,		% width of the text
% 		marginparsep=8.2mm,		% width between text and margin
% 		marginparwidth=49.4mm,	% width of the margin
% 	}%
% }
% \end{lstlisting}

% so if you want to, say, decrease the width of the margin while
% increasing the width of the text, you could write in the preamble of
% your document something like:

% \begin{lstlisting}
% \renewcommand{\marginlayout}{%
% 	\newgeometry{
% 		top=27.4mm,				% height of the top margin
% 		bottom=27.4mm,			% height of the bottom margin
% 		inner=24.8mm,			% width of the inner margin
% 		textwidth=117mm,		% width of the text
% 		marginparsep=8.2mm,		% width between text and margin
% 		marginparwidth=39.4mm,	% width of the margin
% 	}%
% }
% \end{lstlisting}

% where the text width has been increased by 10mm and the margin width has
% been decreased by 10mm.

% \section{Numbers \& Counters}

% In this short section we shall see how dispositions, sidenotes and
% figures are numbered in the \Class{kaobook} class.

% By default, dispositions are numbered up to the section in \Class{kaobook}
% and up to the subsection in \Class{kaohandt}. This can be changed by
% passing the option \Option{secnumdepth} to\Class{kaobook} or
% \Class{kaohandt} (e.g. 1 corresponds to section and 2 corresponds to
% subsections).

% The sidenotes counter is the same across all the document, but if you
% want it to reset at each chapter, just uncomment the line

% \begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain]
% \counterwithin*{sidenote}{chapter}
% \end{lstlisting}

% in the \Package{styles/style.sty} package provided by this class.

% Figure and Table numbering is also per-chapter; to change that, use
% something like:

% \begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain]
% \renewcommand{\thefigure}{\arabic{section}.\arabic{figure}}
% \end{lstlisting}

% \section{White Space}

% One of the things that I find most hard in \LaTeX\xspace is to finely
% tune the white space around objects. There are not fixed rules, each
% object needs its own adjustment. Here we shall see how some spaces are
% defined at the moment in this class.\marginnote{Attention! This section
% may be incomplete.}

% \textbf{Space around sidenotes and citations marks}

% There should be no space before or after sidenotes and citation marks,
% like so:

% sidenote\sidenote{This paragraph can be used to diagnose any problems:
% if you see whitespace around sidenotes or citation marks, probably
% a \% sign is missing somewhere in the definitions of the class
% macros.}sidenote\newline
% citation\cite{James2013}citation

% \textbf{Space around figures and tables}

% \begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain]
% \renewcommand\FBaskip{.4\topskip}
% \renewcommand\FBbskip{\FBaskip}
% \end{lstlisting}

% \textbf{Space around captions}

% \begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain]
% \captionsetup{
% 	aboveskip=6pt,
% 	belowskip=6pt
% }
% \end{lstlisting}

% \textbf{Space around displays (\eg equations)}

% \begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain]
% \setlength\abovedisplayskip{6pt plus 2pt minus 4pt}
% \setlength\belowdisplayskip{6pt plus 2pt minus 4pt}
% \abovedisplayskip 10\p@ \@plus2\p@ \@minus5\p@
% \abovedisplayshortskip \z@ \@plus3\p@
% \belowdisplayskip \abovedisplayskip
% \belowdisplayshortskip 6\p@ \@plus3\p@ \@minus3\p@
% \end{lstlisting}
