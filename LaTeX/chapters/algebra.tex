\chapter{Algebra: Linear vector space}

This chapter will explain and define some mathematic concepts we will used to solve problems with more complicated.

\section{Definition of linear vector space}

A linear vector space is a space where each element of the space is a entry in the space. We will follow the notation for quantum mechanics, where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\ket{v}$         Dirac notation for a vector
  \item $\bra{v}$         Conjugate of the vector
  \item $\braket{v}{v}$   Inner product
\end{itemize}

We can use n-special vector to write down all vector of a space n-dimensional.

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.1}
  \bracket{e_i}{e_j} = \delta_{i,j}
\end{equation}

This vectors are called unit vectores, with them we can write any vector as:

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.2}
  \ket{v} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i \ket{e_i}
\end{equation}

We can get any elemnt of v usign this definitions.

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.3}
  \braket{e_j}{v} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i \braket{e_j}{e_i} = v_j
\end{equation}

All this operations can be done because every linear vector must follow:

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.4}
  \braket{v}{(a\ket{w}+b\ket{w})} = a \braket{v}{w} + b\braket{v}{w}
\end{equation}

As we have a definition for $\ket{v}$, we wat one for $\bra{v}$.

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.5}
  \bra{v} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i^{*}\bra{e_i}
\end{equation}

We can know prove that the inner product is greater or equal to 0.

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.6}
  \braket{v}{v} = (\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i^{*}\bra{e_i})(\sum_{j=1}^{n} v_j \ket{e_j}) = \sum_{i,j=1}^{n} v_i^{*} v_j \braket{e_i}{e_j} = \sum_{i,j=1}^{n} v_i^{*} v_i \geq 0
\end{equation}

And also we have proved that the inner product can only be 0 if $\ket{v} = 0$, and it is called null vector.

Other property of the inner product:


\begin{equation}
  \label{6.7}
  \braket{w}{v} = (\braket{v}{w})^{*}
\end{equation}

We can define a unit vector in direction v as:

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.8}
\ket{\hat{v}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\braket{v}{v}}} \ket{v}
\end{equation}

\section{Inequations}

In two dimensional space the inner product is given by the angle between the two vectors.

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.9}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \vec{v_1} \cdot \vec{v_2} = \sqrt{\vec{v_1}\cdot\vec{v_1}} \sqrt{\vec{v_2}\cdot\vec{v_2}} \cos(\theta)
    \\
    (\vec{v_1} \cdot \vec{v_2})(\vec{v_2} \cdot \vec{v_1}) = (\vec{v_1}\cdot\vec{v_1})  (\vec{v_2}\cdot\vec{v_2}) \cos^2(\theta) \leq (\vec{v_1}\cdot\vec{v_1})  (\vec{v_2}\cdot\vec{v_2})
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

This is known as Schwarz Inequation and can be generalize to every number of dimensions.

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.10}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \braket{w}{v}\braket{v}{w} \leq \braket{v}{v} \braket{w}{w}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

Now we want a relation between the sum of an inner product and it's conjugate.

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.11}
  \braket{w}{v}+\braket{v}{w} \leq 2 \sqrt{\braket{v}{v} \braket{w}{w}}
\end{equation}

Using \ref{6.11} and \ref{6.10} we can get the Triangle Inequality.

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.12}
  \begin{array}{c}
    (\bra{w}+\bra{v})(\ket{w}+\ket{v}) = \braket{w}{w}+\braket{v}{v}+\braket{v}{w}+\braket{w}{v}
    \\

    \\
    (\bra{w}+\bra{v})(\ket{w}+\ket{v}) \leq \sqrt{\braket{w}{w}}^2 + \sqrt{\braket{v}{v}}^2 + 2 \sqrt{\braket{w}{w}} \sqrt{\braket{v}{v}}
    \\

    \\
    \sqrt{(\bra{w}+\bra{v})(\ket{w}+\ket{v})} \leq \sqrt{\braket{w}{w}} + \sqrt{\braket{v}{v}}
    \\

    \\
    Norm(\ket{w}+\ket{v}) \leq Norm(\ket{w}) + Norm(\ket{v})
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

\section{Definitions in Wave Mechanicsand Operators}

In our physical aproach $\ket{e_i}$ is a normalize function in one or more dimension, $\bra{e_i}$ is the conjugate of the function and $\braket{e_i}{e_j}$ is the inner product, define as an integral over all space.

We can rewrite the wave equations for each energy, E_i.

\begin{equation}
\label{6.13}
\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2}+ V(x) \right] \phi_i(x) = [E_i] \phi_i(x)
\end{equation}

Where the left part in brackets is a linear operator in our vector space and is acting an element giving as a result a proportionality with him self.

We have introduced a new concept, the linear operatorr. We say an operator is linear if:

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.14}
  \begin{array}{c}
    A \ket{v} = \ket{w} \\
    A(\alpha_1 \ket{v_1}+\alpha_2\ket{v_2}) = \alpha_1 A \ket{v_1} + \alpha_2 A \ket{v_2}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

Where $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$ are complex numbers. As we did with vectors we have to established some rules.

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.15}
  A \ket{e_i} = \sum_{j} \ket{e_j} A_{ji}
\end{equation}

Given A and the vectors that define our space, $\ket{e_i}$, we can find $A_{ij}$.

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.16}
  \bra{e_k}(A \ket{e_i}) =\bra{e_k}(\sum_{j}\ket{e_j}A_{ji}) = \sum_{j} (\braket{e_k}{e_j})Aji = \sum_{j}\delta_{kj}A_{ji}=A_{ki}
\end{equation}

One consequence of this result is the matrix multiplication acting on components.

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.17}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \ket{w} = A \ket{v} = A \sum_{i} v_i\ket{e_i} = \sum_{i} v_i\sum_{j}\ket{e_j}A_{ji} = \sum_j\sum_i A_{ji} v_i \ket{e_j} = \sum_{j} w_i \ket{e_j}\\
    w_j = \sum_{i}A_{ji} v_i
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

We can aply more than one operator to a vector.

\begin{equation}
  \label{6.18}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \ket{w} = A(B \ket{v}) \\
    w_j = \sum_{i}(A_{ji}(B\ket{v})_i) = \sum_{k}\sum{i}A_{ji}B_{ik}v_k = \sum_{k} (AB)_{jk} v_k
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

In general A and B do not commute.

\begin{equation}
  \ket{x} = (AB-BA) \ket{v}
\end{equation}

We call that difference of the multiplication of the operators, a commutator. It has the property:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c}
    [A,\alpha B + \beta C]\ket{v} = (A(\alpha B+\beta C)-(\alpha B + \beta C)A)\ket{v} =
    \\
    = (\alpha AB+\beta AC-\alpha BA - \beta CA) \ket{v} =
    \\
    = (\alpha (AB-BA)+\beta(AC-CA)) \ket{v}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

This mean that:

\begin{equation}
    [A,\alpha B + \beta C] = \alpha [A,B] + \beta[A,C]
\end{equation}

There is also a rule with the product of two operators.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c}
    [A,BC] = ABC - BCA - BAC + BAC =
    \\
    = (AB-BA)C + B(AC-CA) =
    \\
    = [A,B]C + B[A,C]
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

We called operator adjunt to A to $A^{\dagger}$ if:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c}
    A \ket{v} = \ket{w}
    \\
    \bra A^{\dagger} = \bra{w}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

$A^{\dagger}$ is the transpose complex conjugate of the operator A.

\begin{equation}
  A^{\dagger} = (A^{\star})^{T} = (A^{T})^{\star}
\end{equation}

If $A=A^{\dagger}$ A is called hermitian

If $A=-A^{\dagger}$ A is called anti-hermitian

We define the identity operator, I, as:

\begin{equation}
  (I)_{ij} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lc}
    1 & i=j
    \\
    0 & i \neq j
  \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation}

If $A A^{\dagger} = I$ we say that A is a unitary operator.

We can also prove that $(AB)^{\dagger} = (B^{\dagger}A^{\dagger})$.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c}
    (AB)^{\dagger} = ((AB)^T)^* = (B^TA^T)^*= (B^T)^*(A^T)^* = B^\dagger A^\dagger
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

Considering a hermitian operator H that satisfy:

\begin{equation}
  H\ket{h_i} = h_i \ket{h_i}
\end{equation}

Where $\ket{h_i}$ is an eigenvector such that the action of the operator on it, returns a vector proportional to itself with $h_i$ as the proportionality (eigenvalue).

We can prove that the eigenvalue is a real number.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \bra{h_i}H^{\dagger} = h_i^* \bra{h_i}
    \\
    \bra{h_i}H^{\dagger} = h_i^* \bra{h_i}
    \\
    \bra{h_i}H\ket{h_i} = h_i \braket{h_i}{h_i}
    \\
    \bra{h_i}H\ket{h_i} = h_i^* \braket{h_i}{h_i}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

We can also prove that the different eigenvectors are orthogonal.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \bra{h_j}H\ket{h_i} = h_j \braket{h_i}{h_j}
    \\
    \bra{h_j}H\ket{h_i} = h_i \braket{h_i}{h_j}
    \\
    (h_i-h_j)\braket{h_j}{h_i} = 0
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

If $h_i\neq h_j$ then the eigenvectors are orthogonal. In one dimensional problems we don't have problems because the eigenvalues are unique, we will talk about what happen when they are equal later when we introduce more dimensions.

It can be prove that the set of eigenvectors form a base.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c}
    PROVE \braket{h_i}{h_i} = 1 NOT PROVE YET
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

Coming back to physics with all this properties we will define our inner product and our operator.

\begin{equation}
  \bra{\psi(x)}A\ket{\phi(x)} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\psi^*(x)\left[\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\phi(x)\right]dx
\end{equation}

Where our inner product is the integral of the product of the functions and the operator is the second derivative. We can prove that in this inner product our operator is hermitian with the limits $\phi(\pm \infty) = 0$ and $\psi(\pm \infty) = 0$.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\psi^*(x)\left[\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\phi(x)\right] dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{d}{dx}\left[\psi^*\frac{d}{dx}\phi\right]-\frac{d\psi^*}{dx}\frac{d\phi}{dx} dx =
    \\

    \\
    \left.\psi^*\frac{d\phi}{dx}\right|_{-\infty}^{\infty} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{d\psi^*}{dx}\frac{d\phi}{dx} dx = -\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{d\psi^*}{dx}\phi\right)-\frac{d^2\psi^*}{dx^2}\phi dx =
    \\

    \\
    =\left.\frac{d\psi^*}{dx}\phi\right|_{-\infty}^{\infty} + \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left[\frac{d^2\psi^*}{dx^2}\right]^2\phi dx
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

We have proved that:

\begin{equation}
  \bra{\psi(x)}\left(\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\ket{\phi}\right) = \left(\bra{\psi(x)}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\right)\ket{\phi}
\end{equation}

This means that the operator is hermitian. And it will be also hermitian if we multiply by a real number and add a real number thats why we can say that our operator for the Schr√∂dinger wave equation is hermitian if V(x) is real.

\begin{equation}
  \left[\frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+V(x)\right]\ket{E_i} = E_i \ket{E_i}
\end{equation}

We will need also to explore how the operator d/dx behaves.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\psi^*(x)\left[\frac{d}{dx}\phi(x)\right] dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{d}{dx}\left[\psi^* \phi\right]-\left(\frac{d\psi^*}{dx}\right) \phi dx =
    \\

    \\
    \left.\psi^*\phi\right|_{-\infty}^{\infty} + \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left(-\frac{d}{dx}\psi^*\right)\phi dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left(-\frac{d}{dx}\psi^*\right)\phi dx
    \\

    \\
    \left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)^{\dagger} = -\frac{d}{dx}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

We have proved that this operator is anti-hermitian.

% \section{Citations}

% \index{citations}
% To cite someone \sidecite{Visscher2008,James2013} is very simple: just
% use the \Command{sidecite}\index{\Command{sidecite}} command. It does
% not have an offset argument yet, but it probably will in the future.
% This command supports multiple entries, as you can see, and by default
% it prints the reference on the margin as well as adding it to the
% bibliography at the end of the document. Note that the citations have
% nothing to do with the text,\sidecite{James2013} but they are completely
% random as they only serve the purpose to illustrate the feature.

% For this setup I wrote a separate package, \Package{kaobiblio}, which
% you can find in the \Package{styles} directory and include in your main
% tex file. This package accepts all the options that you can pass to
% \Package{biblatex}, and actually it passes them to \Package{biblatex}
% under the hood. Moreover, it also defines some commands, like
% \Command{sidecite}, and environments that can be used within a
% \Class{kao} book.\sidenote[][-.9cm]{For this reason you should always
% use \Package{kaobiblio} instead of \Package{biblatex}, but the syntax
% and the options are exactly the same.}

% If you want to use \Package{bibtex} instead of \Package{biblatex},
% pass the option \Option{backend=bibtex} to \Package{kaobiblio}.
% \Package{kaobiblio} also supports two options that are not shared with
% \Package{biblatex}: \Option{addspace} and \Option{linkeverything},
% both of which are boolean options, meaning that they can take
% either \enquote{true} or \enquote{false} as a value. If you
% pass \Option{addspace=true} when loading \Package{kaobiblio},
% a space will be automatically added before the citation marks.
% If you pass \Option{linkeverything=true}, the author's name in
% the authoryear-* and authortitle-* styles will be a hyperlink
% like the year.\sidenote{The fact that the author name is not
% a hyperlink bothers more than one biblatex user. There are
% \href{https://github.com/plk/biblatex/issues/428}{strong arguments}
% \emph{against} hyperlinking the author name, but in my personal opinion,
% linking the author's name does not result in any problems in most
% practical cases.}

% As you have seen, the \Command{sidecite} command will print a citation
% in the margin. However, this command would be useless without a way to
% customise the format of the citation, so the \Class{kaobook} provides
% also the \Command{formatmargincitation} command. By \enquote{renewing}
% that command, you can choose which items will be printed in the margins.
% The best way to understand how it works is to see the actual definition
% of this command.

% \begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain,linewidth=1.5\textwidth]
% \newcommand{\formatmargincitation}[1]{%
% 	\parencite{#1}: \citeauthor*{#1} (\citeyear{#1}), \citetitle{#1}%
% }
% \end{lstlisting}

% Thus, the \Command{formatmargincitation} accepts one parameter, which is
% the citation key, and prints the parencite followed by a colon, then the
% author, then the year (in brackets), and finally the
% title.\sidecite{Battle2014} Now, suppose that you wish the margin
% citation to display the year and the author, followed by the title, and
% finally a fixed arbitrary string; you would add to your document:

% \begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain,linewidth=1.5\textwidth]
% \renewcommand{\formatmargincitation}[1]{%
% 	\citeyear{#1}, \citeauthor*{#1}: \citetitle{#1}; very interesting!%
% }
% \end{lstlisting}

% \renewcommand{\formatmargincitation}[1]{%
% 	\citeyear{#1}, \citeauthor*{#1}: \citetitle{#1}; very interesting!%
% }

% The above code results in citations that look like the
% following.\sidecite{Zou2005} Of course, changing the format is most
% useful when you also change the default bibliography style. For
% instance, if you want to use the \enquote{philosophy-modern} style for
% your bibliography, you might have something like this in the preamble:

% \begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain,linewidth=1.5\textwidth]
% \usepackage[style=philosophy-modern]{styles/kaobiblio}
% \renewcommand{\formatmargincitation}[1]{%
% 	\sdcite{#1}%
% }
% \addbibresource{main.bib}
% \end{lstlisting}

% \renewcommand{\formatmargincitation}[1]{%
% 	\parencite{#1}: \citeauthor*{#1} (\citeyear{#1}), \citetitle{#1}%
% }

% The commands like \Command{citeyear}, \Command{parencite}
% and \Command{sdcite} are just examples. A full
% reference of the available commands can be found in this
% \href{http://tug.ctan.org/info/biblatex-cheatsheet/biblatex-cheatsheet.pdf}{cheatsheet},
% under the \enquote{Citations} section.

% Finally, to compile a document containing citations, you need to use an
% external tool, which for this class is biber. You need to run the
% following (assuming that your tex file is called main.tex):

% \begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain]
% $ pdflatex main
% $ biber main
% $ pdflatex main
% \end{lstlisting}

% \section{Glossaries and Indices}

% \index{glossary}
% The \Class{kaobook} class loads the packages \Package{glossaries} and
% \Package{imakeidx}, with which you can add glossaries and indices to
% your book. For instance, I previously defined some glossary entries and
% now I am going to use them, like this: \gls{computer}.
% \Package{glossaries} also allows you to use acronyms, like the
% following: this is the full version, \acrfull{fpsLabel}, and this is the
% short one \acrshort{fpsLabel}. These entries will appear in the glossary
% in the backmatter.

% Unless you use \href{https://www.overleaf.com}{Overleaf} or some other
% fancy IDE for \LaTeX, you need to run an external command from your
% terminal in order to compile a document with a glossary. In particular,
% the commands required are:\sidenote{These are the commands you would run
% in a UNIX system, but see also \nrefsec{compiling}; I have no idea about
% how it works in Windows.}

% \begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain]
% $ pdflatex main
% $ makeglossaries main
% $ pdflatex main
% \end{lstlisting}

% Note that you need not run \texttt{makeglossaries} every time you
% compile your document, but only when you change the glossary entries.

% \index{index}
% To create an index, you need to insert the command
% \lstinline|\index{subject}| whenever you are talking about
% \enquote{subject} in the text. For instance, at the start of this
% paragraph I would write \lstinline|index{index}|, and an entry would be
% added to the Index in the backmatter. Check it out!

% \marginnote[2mm]{In theory, you would need to run an external command
% for the index as well, but luckily the package we suggested,
% 	\Package{imakeidx}, can compile the index automatically.}

% \index{nomenclature}
% A nomenclature is just a special kind of index; you can find one at the end of
% this book. To insert a nomenclature, we use the package \Package{nomencl} and
% add the terms with the command \Command{nomenclature}. We put then a
% \Command{printnomenclature} where we want it to appear.

% Also with this package we need to run an external command to compile the
% document, otherwise the nomenclature will not appear:

% \begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain]
% $ pdflatex main
% $ makeindex main.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o main.nls
% $ pdflatex main
% \end{lstlisting}

% These packages are all loaded in
% \href{style/packages.sty}{packages.sty}, one of the files that come with
% this class. However, the configuration of the elements is best done in
% the main.tex file, since each book will have different entries and
% styles.

% Note that the \Package{nomencl} package caused problems when the
% document was compiled, so, to make a long story short, I had to prevent
% \Package{scrhack} to load the hack-file for \Package{nomencl}. When
% compiling the document on Overleaf, however, this problem seem to
% vanish.

% \marginnote[-19mm]{This brief section was by no means a complete
% reference on the subject, therefore you should consult the documentation
% of the above package to gain a full understanding of how they work.}

% \section{Hyperreferences}
% \labsec{hyprefs}

% \index{hyperreferences}
% Together with this class we provide a handy package to help you
% referencing the same elements always in the same way, for consistency
% across the book. First, you can label each element with a specific
% command. For instance, should you want to label a chapter, you would put
% \lstinline|\labch{chapter-title}| right after the \Command{chapter}
% directive. This is just a convenience, because \Command{labch} is
% actually just an alias to \lstinline|\label{ch:chapter-title}|, so it
% spares you the writing of \enquote{ch:}. We defined similar commands for
% many typically labeled elements, including:

% \begin{multicols}{2}
% \setlength{\columnseprule}{0pt}
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Page: \Command{labpage}
% 	\item Part: \Command{labpart}
% 	\item Chapter: \Command{labch}
% 	\item Section: \Command{labsec}
% 	\item Figure: \Command{labfig}
% 	\item Table: \Command{labtab}
% 	\item Definition: \Command{labdef}
% 	\item Assumption: \Command{labassum}
% 	\item Theorem: \Command{labthm}
% 	\item Proposition: \Command{labprop}
% 	\item Lemma: \Command{lablemma}
% 	\item Remark: \Command{labremark}
% 	\item Example: \Command{labexample}
% 	\item Exercise: \Command{labexercise}
% \end{itemize}
% \end{multicols}

% Of course, we have similar commands for referencing those elements.
% However, since the style of the reference should depend on the context,
% we provide different commands to reference the same thing. For instance,
% in some occasions you may want to reference the chapter by name, but
% other times you want to reference it only by number. In general, there
% are four reference style, which we call plain, vario, name, and full.

% The plain style references only by number. It is accessed, for chapters,
% with \lstinline|\refch{chapter-title}| (for other elements, the syntax
% is analogous). Such a reference results in: \refch{references}.

% The vario and name styles rest upon the \Package{varioref} package.
% Their syntax is \lstinline|\vrefch{chapter-title}| and
% \lstinline|\nrefch{chapter-title}|, and they result in:
% \vrefch{references}, for the vario style, and: \nrefch{references}, for
% the name style. As you can see, the page is referenced in
% \Package{varioref} style.

% The full style references everything. You can use it with
% \lstinline|\frefch{chapter-title}| and it looks like this:
% \frefch{references}.

% Of course, all the other elements have similar commands (\eg for parts
% you would use \lstinline|\vrefpart{part-title}| or something like that).
% However, not all elements implement all the four styles. The commands
% provided should be enough, but if you want to see what is available or
% to add the missing ones, have a look at the
% \href{styles/kaorefs.sty}{attached package}.

% In order to have access to all these features, the \Package{kaorefs}
% should be loaded in the preamble of your document. It should be loaded
% last, or at least after \Package{babel} (or \Package{polyglossia}) and
% \Package{plaintheorems} (or \Package{mdftheorems}). Options can be
% passed to it like to any other package; in particular, it is possible to
% specify the language of the captions. For instance, if you specify
% \enquote{italian} as an option, instead of \enquote{Chapter} it will be
% printed \enquote{Capitolo}, the Italian analog. If you know other
% languages, you are welcome to contribute the translations of these
% captions! Feel free to contact the author of the class for further
% details.

% The \Package{kaorefs} package also include \Package{cleveref}, so it is

% \section{A Final Note on Compilation}
% \labsec{compiling}

% Probably the easiest way to compile a latex document is with the
% \Package{latexmk} script, as it can take care of everything, if properly
% configured, from the bibliography to the glossary. The command to issue,
% in general, is:

% \begin{lstlisting}
% latexmk [latexmk_options] [filename ...]
% \end{lstlisting}

% \Package{latexmk} can be extensively configured (see
% \url{https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html}). For convenience, I print
% here an example configuration that would cover all the steps described
% above.

% \begin{lstlisting}
% # By default compile only the file called 'main.tex'
% @default_files = ('main.tex');

% # Compile the glossary and acronyms list (package 'glossaries')
% add_cus_dep( 'acn', 'acr', 0, 'makeglossaries' );
% add_cus_dep( 'glo', 'gls', 0, 'makeglossaries' );
% $clean_ext .= " acr acn alg glo gls glg";
% sub makeglossaries {
%    my ($base_name, $path) = fileparse( $_[0] );
%    pushd $path;
%    my $return = system "makeglossaries", $base_name;
%    popd;
%    return $return;
% }

% # Compile the nomenclature (package 'nomencl')
% add_cus_dep( 'nlo', 'nls', 0, 'makenlo2nls' );
% sub makenlo2nls {
%     system( "makeindex -s nomencl.ist -o \"$_[0].nls\" \"$_[0].nlo\"" );
% }
% \end{lstlisting}

% However, if you'd rather not use an external package and want to do
% everything manually, here are some tips.\sidenote{As the author only
% uses Linux and compiles everything from the command line, he doesn't
% know how the compilation works in Windows or Mac. The tips, therefore,
% refer to the usage with Linux from the command line.}

% \minisec{Compiling the examples in the kaobook repository}
% To compile the examples, and in particular the documentation, that are
% in the \Path{examples} directory of the
% \href{https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook}{kaobook repository} on
% GitHub, do as follows. \lstinline[language=bash]|cd| into the root
% directory of the repository, and run
% \lstinline|pdflatex -output-directory examples/documentation main.tex|.
% With this trick, you can compile the documentation using the class files
% pertaining to the repository (and not, say, those in your texmf tree).
% The \enquote{-output-directory} option works with the other
% \LaTeX-related commands such as biber and makeglossaries.

% A note of warning: sometimes \LaTeX\ needs more than one run to get the
% correct position of each element; this is true in particular for the
% positioning of floating elements like figures, tables, and margin notes.
% Occasionally, \LaTeX\ can need up to four re-runs, so If the alignment
% of margin elements looks odd, or if they bleed into ther main text, try
% runnign pdflatex one more time.
